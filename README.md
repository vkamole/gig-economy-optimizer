# **Kenya Gig Economy Optimizer**  
### **Connecting Informal Workers with Opportunities Using AI**  

![Streamlit App Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Platform-Streamlit-FF4B4B?logo=streamlit)  
![SDG 8](https://img.shields.io/badge/SDG-8_Decent_Work-0A97D9?logo=united-nations)  

## **📌 Overview**  
This project leverages **AI-driven job matching** to optimize Kenya’s informal gig economy (e.g., *mamafua*, plumbers, cleaners, drivers*) by:  
- **Matching workers** with nearby jobs using **TF-IDF and cosine similarity**.  
- **Predicting fair wages** based on skills, location, and demand.  
- **Increasing income stability** through data-driven job allocation.  

**Alignment with SDG 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth)**:  
✅ Reduces unemployment in informal sectors  
✅ Promotes fair wages and financial inclusion  
✅ Improves access to consistent work opportunities

## **📈 Impact Metrics (SDG 8 Alignment)**  
| Metric | Target |  
|--------|--------|  
| **Jobs Matched/Month** | 1,000+ informal workers |  
| **Income Increase** | 20-30% via optimized pricing |  
| **Reduced Job Search Time** | 50% faster matching |  

**Why This Works for Kenya**:  
- 83% of Kenya’s workforce is in the informal sector (*World Bank, 2023*)  
- AI reduces friction in connecting workers with clients  

---

## **🌍 Future Roadmap**  
- **M-Pesa Integration**: Direct in-app payments for gigs  
- **SMS Notifications**: For workers without smartphones  
- **Upskilling Recommendations**: Partner with online courses (e.g., Coursera)
